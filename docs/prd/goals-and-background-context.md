# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deliver a high-performance TUI application for generating standardized LLM prompts from templates
- Enable rapid, consistent prompt creation with project file context integration
- Provide intuitive keyboard-only navigation across all workflow steps
- Support both built-in and user-customized template workflows
- Achieve cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS) with excellent terminal support

### Background Context

The shotgun-cli addresses the critical need for standardized prompt generation in LLM-driven development workflows. Currently, developers manually copy-paste file contents and reconstruct context repeatedly, leading to formatting inconsistencies and time waste.

This TUI application, built with Go 1.22+ and Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4, provides a wizard-driven interface that automatically maps project file structures, applies .gitignore/.shotgunignore rules, and generates comprehensive prompts through template-driven workflows. The solution targets development teams requiring reproducible, context-rich prompts for code analysis, debugging, planning, and project management tasks.
