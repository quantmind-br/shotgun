# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a functional TUI application that standardizes LLM prompt generation for development teams
- Achieve <2 minute prompt generation time from project context to formatted output
- Support cross-platform deployment (Windows, macOS, Linux) with single binary distribution
- Provide built-in templates covering 80% of common developer LLM use cases
- Enable team-wide adoption through zero-configuration startup and intuitive keyboard navigation
- Establish foundation for community-driven template ecosystem post-MVP

## Background Context

Shotgun CLI addresses the growing friction between developers' increasing reliance on LLMs and the inefficient, manual processes currently required to provide context to these tools. As development teams integrate AI assistants into their workflows for code review, debugging, and planning, they face repetitive tasks of copying files, formatting prompts, and maintaining consistency across team members. This tool transforms prompt generation from a manual, error-prone process into a streamlined, reproducible workflow that maintains developers in their terminal environment.

The solution leverages Go's cross-platform capabilities and the Bubble Tea TUI framework to deliver a lightweight, performant tool that integrates seamlessly into existing development workflows. By focusing specifically on the developer use case with repository-aware features and development-focused templates, Shotgun CLI aims to become the standard utility for LLM prompt generation in software development.
