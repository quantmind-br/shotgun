# Epic 5 - Polish & Cross-Platform Optimization

**Epic Goal:** Refine the complete user interface with professional monochrome styling, implement session management and workflow history, optimize performance for large-scale repositories, and ensure robust cross-platform terminal compatibility for production deployment.

### Story 5.1: Professional UI Styling and Theme Implementation
As a user,
I want a polished, professional interface with consistent styling,
so that I have a pleasant, distraction-free experience that works beautifully across all terminals.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete monochrome theme implementation using Lip Gloss with specified color palette
2. Consistent styling across all screens: headers, borders, progress bars, text editors
3. Professional typography with proper spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy
4. Accent color usage (mint green #6ee7b7) for focus states and highlights
5. Status indicators and progress bars with smooth animations and clear visual feedback
6. Terminal responsiveness handling various window sizes gracefully (minimum 80x24)
7. Theme consistency testing across major terminal emulators (PowerShell, bash, iTerm2, WezTerm)

### Story 5.2: Session Management and History System
As a user,
I want my previous sessions saved and easily restorable,
so that I can quickly repeat similar workflows or recover from interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Session persistence system saving user selections, template choices, and input content
2. Cross-platform session storage in appropriate config directories
3. Session history interface showing recent sessions with timestamps and summary info
4. Quick restore functionality allowing users to load and modify previous configurations
5. Session management: configurable history limit, cleanup of old sessions
6. Auto-save during workflow to prevent data loss on unexpected exits
7. Privacy controls: option to disable session saving or clear history

### Story 5.3: Performance Optimization for Large Repositories  
As a user,
I want the application to remain responsive even with very large codebases,
so that I can use it effectively on enterprise-scale projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Optimized file scanning with configurable concurrency and memory limits
2. Virtual scrolling in file tree for repositories with 10,000+ files
3. Lazy loading of file content with streaming processing to minimize memory usage
4. Background processing with progress indication for expensive operations
5. Configurable limits: max files to display, max file size to include, scan timeouts
6. Performance monitoring and user feedback for operations approaching limits
7. Graceful degradation when hitting system or configured limits
8. Memory usage optimization keeping total RAM usage under 200MB for large repos

### Story 5.4: Cross-Platform Terminal Compatibility
As a user,
I want the application to work flawlessly on all major operating systems and terminals,
so that I can use it consistently across different development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Windows terminal compatibility: PowerShell, CMD, Windows Terminal, ConPTY support
2. Linux terminal support: bash, zsh, fish shells with various terminal emulators
3. macOS compatibility: Terminal.app, iTerm2, with proper key binding handling
4. Unicode and UTF-8 rendering consistency across all supported platforms
5. Keyboard shortcut handling accounting for OS-specific key combinations
6. Color support detection with graceful fallback for limited terminals
7. Integration testing on all target platforms with automated CI/CD validation

### Story 5.5: Advanced Configuration and CLI Integration
As a user,
I want comprehensive configuration options and CLI convenience features,
so that I can customize the application to fit my specific workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Configuration system with YAML/TOML config files for user preferences
2. Command-line interface with Cobra framework supporting direct prompt generation
3. CLI flags for common operations: --template, --task, --output, --quick modes
4. Configuration options: default templates, file exclusions, UI preferences, performance tuning
5. Environment variable support for CI/CD integration and automation
6. `shotgun init` command for project setup with example .shotgunignore
7. `shotgun --help` with comprehensive usage documentation and examples
8. Integration with shell completion for enhanced CLI experience
