## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3: FileTree screen complete with full Bubble Tea MVC pattern implementation. FileTree provides validation point for F3 navigation (requires selected files). Screen follows established component organization with model/update/view/keys separation. Integration with Scanner service working correctly.

### Tech Stack & Dependencies
- **Frontend Framework**: Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4 for TUI framework with message-based navigation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **UI Components**: Bubbles v0.21.0 for help dialog and confirmation components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Styling**: Lip Gloss v1.0.0 for progress indicator and help dialog styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **State Management**: Bubble Tea Models with immutable state management for screen persistence [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Testing**: Go testing standard library, teatest for TUI flow testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Data Models
- **AppState Structure**: CurrentScreen (ScreenType), FileTree (FileTreeModel), Template (TemplateModel), TaskInput (InputModel), RulesInput (InputModel), Confirmation (ConfirmModel), SelectedFiles ([]string), SelectedTemplate (*Template), TaskContent (string), RulesContent (string), WindowSize (tea.WindowSizeMsg), Error (error) [Source: architecture/data-models.md#appstate, architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- **ScreenType Enum**: FileTreeScreen, TemplateScreen, TaskScreen, RulesScreen, ConfirmScreen constants [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]
- **Navigation Messages**: Screen transition messages, validation failure messages, help display messages [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]

### Component Specifications
- **AppState Management**: Central state manager with screen models and shared data [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- **Global Key Handler**: F1 (help), F2 (previous), F3 (next), ESC (exit) key processing [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- **Progress Indicator**: Current screen display (1/5, 2/5, etc.) with visual progress bar [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- **Help System**: Contextual help content for each screen type [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- **Exit Confirmation**: Two-choice dialog (Yes/No) with proper focus management [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]

### File Locations for Implementation
- **Main App Controller**: `internal/app/app.go`, `model.go`, `update.go`, `view.go`, `keys.go` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Progress Component**: `internal/components/progress/model.go` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Data Models**: `internal/models/state.go` for AppState and screen types [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Styles**: `internal/styles/components.go` for progress and help styling [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Testing**: Tests co-located with source files in same directory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]

### Technical Constraints
- **Immutable State**: Use Bubble Tea message passing for all state updates [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]

- **Resource Cleanup**: Always use defer for cleanup operations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Context Propagation**: Pass context.Context for cancellable operations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Screen Flow and Validation Rules
```
Screen Flow: FileTree (1/5) → Template (2/5) → TaskInput (3/5) → RulesInput (4/5) → Confirm (5/5)

Validation Rules:
- FileTree: len(m.SelectedFiles) > 0
- Template: m.SelectedTemplate != nil  
- TaskInput: m.TaskContent != ""
- RulesInput: true (optional, F4 to skip)
- Confirm: true (final screen)
```

### Key Navigation Patterns
```go
// Global key handling pattern from architecture
switch msg.String() {
case "f1":
    return m, m.showHelp()
case "f2":
    return m.goToPreviousScreen()
case "f3": 
    return m.goToNextScreen()
case "esc":
    return m, m.showExitDialog()
}
```
