## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 (Template Processing Engine):
- Template engine is complete and ready to process FILE_STRUCTURE variable
- Template system expects FILE_STRUCTURE to be generated by scanner/builder services
- Variable substitution system operational, ready for file structure integration
- Integration point established: Templates will call FileStructureBuilder via variable processing

### Data Models
**FileItem Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#fileitem]:
- FileItem.Path (string) - Absolute file path for content reading
- FileItem.Name (string) - Display name (basename) for tree visualization  
- FileItem.IsDir (bool) - Directory flag for hierarchy building
- FileItem.IsSelected (bool) - Selection state for filtering
- FileItem.IsBinary (bool) - Binary file indicator for skip logic
- FileItem.Size (int64) - File size in bytes for streaming decisions
- FileItem.Children ([]FileItem) - Child items for recursive tree building

**AppState Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#appstate]:
- AppState.SelectedFiles ([]string) - Selected file paths input to FileStructureBuilder
- AppState.FileTree ([]FileItem) - Source data for file metadata and structure
- FileStructureBuilder will process SelectedFiles to generate FILE_STRUCTURE variable content

### Component Specifications
**File Structure Builder Service** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]:
- Responsibility: Generate tree-structured file content representation for template variables
- Key Interfaces:
  - GenerateStructure(ctx context.Context, selectedFiles []string) (string, error) - Main assembly function
  - SetOptions(opts ...Option) - Configure tree format, concurrency, file size limits
- Dependencies: File system I/O, binary detection, concurrent processing
- Technology Stack: Go standard library, existing scanner service integration

**Service Architecture** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
```
internal/core/builder/
├── structure.go     # File structure assembly (THIS STORY)  
├── pipeline.go      # Processing pipeline (EXISTING)
└── writer.go        # Output generation (EXISTING)
```

### API Specifications
**File Structure Builder Interface**:
```go
type FileStructureBuilder interface {
    GenerateStructure(ctx context.Context, files []string) (string, error)
    SetMaxFileSize(size int64) error
    SetMaxConcurrency(workers int) error
    SetTreeFormat(format TreeFormat) error
}

type TreeFormat struct {
    UseUnicode    bool     // Use Unicode or ASCII tree characters
    ShowSizes     bool     // Include file sizes in output
    ShowBinary    bool     // Show binary file placeholders
    IndentSize    int      // Spaces per indentation level
}
```

**Integration with Template Engine** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#variable]:
- FILE_STRUCTURE variable will be populated by FileStructureBuilder.GenerateStructure()
- Output format: Tree structure + file contents wrapped in XML tags
- Called during template processing pipeline when FILE_STRUCTURE variable is encountered
- Must support context cancellation for long-running operations

### File Locations
