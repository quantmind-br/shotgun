## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.1 (Global Keyboard Navigation):
- Successfully implemented global key handler with context-sensitive behavior
- ESC key confirmation dialog pattern established - can be extended for cancellation during operations
- Bubble Tea message passing and tea.Cmd composition patterns working well
- Animation and UI update patterns established with help overlay
- Test coverage improved to 50.6% - continue this trend with progress indicators

### Data Models

**Spinner Component Model** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:
```go
type SpinnerModel struct {
    spinner  spinner.Model  // Bubbles spinner component
    loading  bool
    message  string
    style    lipgloss.Style
}

type SpinnerStyle string
const (
    SpinnerDots   SpinnerStyle = "dots"
    SpinnerLine   SpinnerStyle = "line" 
    SpinnerCircle SpinnerStyle = "circle"
)
```

**Enhanced Progress Model** [Source: architecture/components.md#screen-components]:
```go
type ProgressModel struct {
    current     int
    total       int
    width       int
    percentage  float64
    message     string
    startTime   time.Time
    bytesRead   int64
    totalBytes  int64
    showETA     bool
}
```

**Loading State Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#appstate]:
- Add to AppState: `Loading bool` - Global loading state
- Add to AppState: `LoadingMessage string` - Current operation description
- FileTreeModel: `scanning bool` - File scan in progress
- TemplateModel: `discovering bool` - Template discovery in progress
- ConfirmModel: `calculating bool` - Size calculation in progress

### Component Specifications

**Spinner Component** [Source: architecture/components.md#screen-components]:
- Location: `internal/components/spinner/`
- Responsibility: Animated loading indicators for async operations
- Key Interfaces:
  - New(style SpinnerStyle) SpinnerModel - Create spinner with style
  - Update(msg tea.Msg) (SpinnerModel, tea.Cmd) - Handle tick messages
  - View() string - Render spinner animation
  - SetMessage(msg string) - Update loading message
- Dependencies: Bubble Tea framework, Bubbles spinner, Lip Gloss styling

**Enhanced Progress Bar** [Source: architecture/components.md#screen-components]:
- Location: `internal/components/progress/`
- Responsibility: Visual progress tracking with percentage and ETA
- Existing Methods to Enhance:
  - SetCurrent(n int) - Add percentage calculation
  - View() string - Add percentage and ETA display
- New Methods:
  - SetBytes(read, total int64) - Track byte-level progress
  - GetETA() time.Duration - Calculate estimated time remaining

### Technical Constraints

**Bubble Tea Animation** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- Use tea.Tick for smooth animations (target 60 FPS)
- Implement tea.tickMsg handling in Update functions
- Compose tea.Cmd for concurrent animations
- Use tea.Batch for multiple simultaneous updates

**Terminal Compatibility** [Source: Epic 4.3 context]:
- Test spinner animations on Windows Terminal, PowerShell, CMD
- Verify progress bars render correctly on macOS Terminal, iTerm2
- Ensure Unicode spinner characters have ASCII fallbacks
- Handle limited color terminals with graceful degradation

**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Minimize terminal redraws during animations
- Use buffered channels for progress updates
- Implement debouncing for rapid progress changes
- Avoid blocking operations in Update() functions

```go
const MinSpinnerDuration = 500 * time.Millisecond

type LoadingTracker struct {
    startTime time.Time
    minShown  bool
}

func (l *LoadingTracker) ShouldHide() bool {
    elapsed := time.Since(l.startTime)
    return elapsed >= MinSpinnerDuration
}
```

### Cancellation Handling

**ESC Key Cancellation** [Source: Story 4.1 context - ESC handling]:
- Reuse ESC confirmation dialog pattern from Story 4.1
- Create context.Context for cancellable operations
- Propagate cancellation through channels
- Clean up resources on cancellation
- Show cancellation confirmation: "Operation cancelled"

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Outstanding implementation quality.** The Story 4.2 implementation demonstrates exceptional adherence to architectural patterns with excellent separation of concerns. The new spinner component and enhanced progress bar component follow Bubble Tea patterns perfectly with proper message handling and state management. The common constants file provides excellent consistency across components, and the anti-flicker mechanisms with 500ms minimum display duration prevent jarring UI changes.

Key strengths:
- **Architecture Compliance**: Perfect adherence to Elm architecture (Model/View/Update) patterns
- **Code Organization**: Well-structured component separation with clear responsibilities
- **Error Handling**: Proper context-based cancellation throughout all async operations
- **Performance**: 60 FPS animation targeting with efficient update mechanisms
- **Testability**: High test coverage with comprehensive integration tests

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The code quality is exceptionally high and follows all established patterns correctly.
