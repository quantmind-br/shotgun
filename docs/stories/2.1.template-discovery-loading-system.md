4. Template validation ensures required fields are present
5. Templates with parsing errors are skipped with warning logs
6. Both built-in and user templates appear in unified list

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4: AppState management system established with screen persistence. Global navigation (F1/F2/F3) implemented and working. Template screen will be screen 2 of 5 in the wizard flow. The AppState.SelectedTemplate field exists and is ready to store the chosen template. Navigation validation requires setting this field before F3 advancement.

- **Panic Recovery**: Never panic in library code, only in main() [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Template Discovery Logic
```
Built-in Templates (embedded):
- Load from embedded templates/ directory using Go embed
- Parse each .toml file into Template struct
- Validate required fields and structure

User Templates:
- Scan ~/.config/shotgun-cli/templates (or %APPDATA%\shotgun-cli\templates on Windows)  
- Parse each .toml file into Template struct
- Validate and merge with built-in templates
- User templates with same ID override built-in versions

Unified List:
- Combine both sources with deduplication by Template.ID
- Sort by Name for consistent display order
- Cache results in sync.Map for performance
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]

### TOML Template Format
```toml
# Template metadata
name = "Analyze Bug"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Analyzes code to identify and fix bugs"
author = "Shotgun Team"
tags = ["debugging", "analysis"]

# Template variables
[variables.task_description]
name = "task_description"
type = "multiline"
required = true
placeholder = "Describe the bug you're experiencing..."

[variables.urgency]
name = "urgency"
type = "choice"  
required = false
default = "medium"
options = ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]

# Template content with variable placeholders
content = """
# Bug Analysis Request

## Description
{{task_description}}

## Urgency: {{urgency}}

## Files to Analyze
{{selected_files}}
"""
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#template]
