### Data Models

**Version Embedding Structure** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#build-command]:
```go
// cmd/shotgun/main.go - Version variables for build-time embedding
var (
    Version   = "dev"           // Set via ldflags during build
    BuildTime = "unknown"       // Set via ldflags during build  
    GitCommit = "unknown"       // Set via ldflags during build
)

// VersionInfo struct for --version command
type VersionInfo struct {
    Version   string `json:"version"`
    BuildTime string `json:"build_time"`
    GitCommit string `json:"git_commit"`
    Platform  string `json:"platform"`
    GoVersion string `json:"go_version"`
}
```

### Component Specifications

**GitHub Actions Release Workflow** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#ci/cd-pipeline]:
- Location: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Trigger: Git tags (v*) and manual workflow_dispatch
- Build Matrix: 7 platform/architecture combinations
- Build Flags: `-ldflags="-s -w -X main.Version={version} -X main.BuildTime={timestamp} -X main.GitCommit={commit}"`
- CGO: Disabled (CGO_ENABLED=0) for static binaries
- Archive Format: tar.gz (Unix), zip (Windows)

**Version Command Implementation** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#cmd-structure]:
- Location: `cmd/shotgun/main.go`
- Responsibility: Display embedded build information
- Integration: Cobra CLI subcommand (version)
- Output Format: JSON and human-readable options
- Information Displayed: Version, build time, git commit, platform, Go version

### File Locations

**Enhanced Files** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `cmd/shotgun/main.go` - Add version variables and --version command
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Optimize and enhance existing workflow
- `README.md` - Add comprehensive installation instructions and download links

**No New Files Required**:
- Release infrastructure already exists and is functional
- CI/CD pipeline already covers required platforms
- Archive and checksum generation already implemented

### Technical Constraints

**Build Optimization** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#build-command]:
- Use `-ldflags="-s -w"` to strip debug info and symbol table (reduces binary size ~30%)
- Static binaries via CGO_ENABLED=0 for maximum compatibility
- Version embedding via -X flag during build time
- Build reproducibility through consistent build environment (Ubuntu latest)

**Platform Support Matrix** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- **Primary Platforms**: Linux (amd64, arm64), macOS (amd64, arm64), Windows (amd64, arm64)
- **Secondary Platforms**: FreeBSD (amd64) for Unix compatibility
- **Go Version**: 1.22+ required, 1.23 used in CI
- **Architecture**: Native compilation for each target platform

**Release Artifact Requirements** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-strategy]:
- Binary naming: `shotgun-{platform}-{architecture}[.exe]`
- Archive naming: `shotgun-{platform}-{architecture}.[tar.gz|zip]`
- Checksum files: `.sha256` suffix for all artifacts
- GitHub Releases: Automatic upload via softprops/action-gh-release@v2
- Retention: 90-day artifact retention for CI builds

### Release Workflow Architecture

**Pre-Release Validation** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:
- Full test suite execution (unit, integration, e2e)
- Terminal compatibility testing across configurations
- Cross-platform build verification
- Security scanning completion
- Coverage threshold validation (90% minimum)

**Build Process Optimization**:
```yaml
# Enhanced build step with version embedding
go build \
  -v \
  -ldflags="-s -w -X main.Version=${VERSION} -X main.BuildTime=$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S') -X main.GitCommit=${GITHUB_SHA}" \
  -o "${BINARY_NAME}" \
  ./cmd/shotgun
```

**Archive Creation Strategy**:
- Unix platforms: tar.gz with README.md, LICENSE (if present)
- Windows platforms: zip with README.md, LICENSE (if present)
- Graceful fallback if documentation files missing
- Consistent directory structure within archives

**GitHub Release Integration**:
- Automated release creation with comprehensive release notes
- Platform compatibility matrix in release description
- Terminal compatibility features documentation
- Installation instructions for each platform
- Checksum verification guidance

- `cmd/shotgun/main_test.go` - Version command and CLI entry point tests
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Enhanced with additional verification steps
- Manual release testing with pre-release tags
- End-to-end release verification including:
  - Binary execution on target platforms
  - Archive extraction and content verification
  - Checksum validation
  - Installation instruction accuracy
- Test coverage minimum 90% maintained for enhanced version handling [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
