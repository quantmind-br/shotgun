### Data Models

**ConfirmModel Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:
```go
type ConfirmModel struct {
    // Summary data
    template     *Template

- Test fixtures: `internal/screens/confirm/testdata/` for mock AppState data
- Size estimation tests: `internal/core/builder/estimator_test.go`

### Technical Constraints

**Size Calculation Performance** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Must handle large file sets (1000+ files) without blocking UI
- Use goroutines for async size calculation with progress updates
- Context cancellation support for responsive user cancellation
- Cache file size information to avoid redundant file system calls
- Memory-efficient calculation without loading entire file contents

**Error Handling Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- All functions that can fail must return error as last value
- Graceful handling of inaccessible files during size calculation
- Clear error messages for file system issues and permission problems
- Fallback size estimation when exact calculation fails
- Never panic during size calculation or screen rendering

**UI Responsiveness** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- Bubble Tea message-driven architecture for non-blocking operations
- Progress updates must not impact screen rendering performance
- Smooth progress bar animation using Bubbles progress component
- Responsive layout adaptation to terminal size changes
- Keyboard navigation must remain responsive during calculations

### Size Estimation Logic

**Template Size Calculation**:
1. Process template with current variables using existing template engine
2. Calculate processed template character count (UTF-8 aware)
3. Add estimated markdown formatting overhead (headers, code blocks)
4. Include variable substitution expansion factor estimation

**File Structure Size Calculation** [Source: Stories 3.1, 3.2 context]:
1. Sum selected file sizes from FileItem metadata (from scanner service)
2. Add tree structure ASCII character overhead (├── └── │ characters)
3. Add XML tag overhead: `<file path="...">content</file>` per file
4. Include XML escaping expansion factor for special characters
5. Add file path string overhead in tree structure display

**Warning Threshold Logic**:
- **Normal**: <100KB (green indicator)
- **Large**: 100KB-500KB (yellow warning)
- **Very Large**: 500KB-2MB (orange warning with optimization suggestions)
- **Excessive**: >2MB (red warning with confirmation prompt)

### Integration Points

**Template Engine Integration** [Source: Story 3.1 completion]:
- Use existing ProcessTemplate functionality for size estimation
- Process template with current variables to get accurate processed size
- Handle template processing errors gracefully during estimation
- Reuse template function library for consistent processing

**File Structure Builder Integration** [Source: Story 3.2 completion]:
- Leverage FileStructureBuilder for file content size calculation
- Use existing binary file detection to exclude from size calculation
- Integrate with concurrent file processing for progress tracking
- Reuse XML escaping logic for accurate overhead calculation

**Screen Flow Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]:
- Transition from Rules Input Screen (or Task Input if rules skipped)
- Return navigation to Rules Input with F2 key
- Forward navigation to generation phase with F10 key
- AppState synchronization during screen transitions
