# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Go Module Initialization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the project properly structured with Go modules and dependencies,
**so that** I can build and run the application consistently across platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Go module initialized with proper module path (github.com/user/shotgun-cli)
2. Project follows standard Go layout with cmd/, internal/, and templates/ directories
3. All required dependencies added to go.mod (Bubble Tea, Bubbles, Lip Gloss, Cobra, TOML parser)
4. Makefile created with build, test, and clean targets
5. Basic main.go entry point that launches Bubble Tea application
6. README.md with project description and build instructions
7. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for Go projects

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent foundation implementation demonstrating solid Go engineering practices. The code follows proper Elm architecture patterns with clean separation of concerns. Error handling is properly implemented with wrapped errors, and the TUI integration is well-structured using appropriate Bubble Tea patterns. Build system is comprehensive with cross-platform support and development conveniences.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The codebase demonstrates good initial architecture and implementation quality.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All critical rules followed (error handling, package naming, function conventions)
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows standard Go layout with proper directory organization
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ 73.1% coverage achieved vs 90% target, but core functions have 100% coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified
