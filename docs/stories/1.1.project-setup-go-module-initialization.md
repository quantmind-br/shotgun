# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Go Module Initialization

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** the project properly structured with Go modules and dependencies,  
**so that** I can build and run the application consistently across platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Go module initialized with proper module path (github.com/user/shotgun-cli)
2. Project follows standard Go layout with cmd/, internal/, and templates/ directories
3. All required dependencies added to go.mod (Bubble Tea, Bubbles, Lip Gloss, Cobra, TOML parser)
4. Makefile created with build, test, and clean targets
5. Basic main.go entry point that launches Bubble Tea application
6. README.md with project description and build instructions
7. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for Go projects

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize Go module (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Run `go mod init github.com/user/shotgun-cli` in project root
  - [ ] Verify go.mod file created with correct module path
- [ ] Create standard Go project structure (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create cmd/shotgun/ directory for main application entry point
  - [ ] Create internal/ directory for private packages
  - [ ] Create templates/ directory for built-in prompt templates
  - [ ] Verify structure matches architecture specification
- [ ] Add required dependencies to go.mod (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea v2.0.0-beta.4
  - [ ] Add github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles v0.21.0
  - [ ] Add github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss v1.0.0
  - [ ] Add github.com/spf13/cobra for CLI framework
  - [ ] Add TOML parsing library for configuration
  - [ ] Run `go mod tidy` to update go.sum
- [ ] Create Makefile with standard targets (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add build target that compiles to bin/shotgun
  - [ ] Add test target that runs all unit tests
  - [ ] Add clean target that removes build artifacts
  - [ ] Add cross-platform build targets for Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] Implement basic main.go entry point (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create cmd/shotgun/main.go with Bubble Tea initialization
  - [ ] Implement minimal app model following Elm architecture
  - [ ] Add basic error handling and graceful shutdown
  - [ ] Verify application launches without errors
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add project description matching PRD goals
  - [ ] Include build instructions using Makefile
  - [ ] Add usage examples and keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Document development setup and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Initialize Git repository with Go-specific .gitignore (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Run `git init` if not already initialized
  - [ ] Create .gitignore with Go patterns (bin/, vendor/, *.exe, etc.)
  - [ ] Add initial commit with project structure
  - [ ] Verify clean git status after initial commit

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]
- **Elm Architecture**: Single source of truth state management with immutable updates via Bubble Tea
- **Model-View-Update (MVU)**: Pure functional updates with command-based side effects
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable TUI components using Bubbles library

### Module Path Configuration
- Use placeholder module path: `github.com/user/shotgun-cli`
- This should be updated to actual GitHub repository URL when created
- Module path affects import statements and dependency resolution

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards]
- **Type Definitions**: Always define types in internal/models and import from there
- **Error Handling**: All functions that can fail must return error as last value
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always use defer for cleanup operations
- **Testing Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage for core packages
- **Panic Recovery**: Never panic in library code, only in main()

### Testing
**Test File Location**: Same directory as source files with _test.go suffix
**Test Standards**: Use Go standard testing package with table-driven tests
**Testing Framework**: Go testing (standard library) with teatest for TUI components
**Coverage Requirement**: Minimum 90% coverage for core packages
**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for file operations

### File Locations
- Main entry point: `cmd/shotgun/main.go`
- Core business logic: `internal/core/` packages
- TUI components: `internal/components/` and `internal/screens/`
- Built-in templates: `templates/` directory
- Configuration: User's `~/.config/shotgun-cli/` directory

### Dependencies Version Requirements
- Go 1.22+ minimum for modern features and performance
- Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4 for latest TUI capabilities
- Bubbles v0.21.0 for component library compatibility
- Lip Gloss v1.0.0 for stable styling API
