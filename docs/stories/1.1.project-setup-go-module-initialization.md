## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the foundation story (1.1).

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

The project must follow the established Go TUI application structure:

**Root Level:**
- cmd/shotgun/main.go - Main application entry point
- internal/ - Private application packages organized by layer
- templates/ - Embedded template assets (embedded/, examples/)
- configs/ - Configuration files and examples
- scripts/ - Build and development scripts
- docs/ - Documentation (prd/, architecture/, stories/)
- test/ - End-to-end and integration tests
- .github/workflows/ - CI/CD pipeline definitions

**Internal Package Organization:**
- internal/ui/ - TUI "Frontend" Layer (app/, screens/, components/, styles/, messages/)
- internal/core/ - "Backend" Processing Engine (scanner/, template/, ignore/, output/)
- internal/services/ - Application services layer (coordinator, session, config)
- internal/models/ - Shared data structures (application, files, templates, config)
- internal/infrastructure/ - External dependencies abstraction (filesystem/, storage/, platform/)
- internal/testutil/ - Testing utilities and helpers (fixtures/, mocks/, helpers)

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Core Dependencies (exact versions required):**
- Go 1.22+ - Primary language with native compilation and concurrency
- Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4 - Reactive terminal interface framework
- Bubbles v0.21.0 - Pre-built TUI components with horizontal scrolling
- Lip Gloss v1.0.0 - Advanced terminal styling with gradients
- doublestar v4.6+ - Glob pattern matching for .gitignore support
- filetype v1.1+ - Binary file detection using magic numbers
- Viper v1.18+ - Cross-platform configuration management
- Cobra v1.8+ - CLI framework with shell completion
- BurntSushi/toml v1.3+ - TOML format for template metadata
- teatest v0.1+ - TUI interaction testing helpers

**Build and Development Tools:**
- Go toolchain 1.22+ - Native build system with cross-compilation
- Makefile with GNU Make - Simple, universal build automation
- golangci-lint v1.55+ - Comprehensive linter suite
- GitHub Actions - CI/CD with matrix builds for cross-platform

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Package Structure Rules:**
- Always follow internal/ structure: ui/ for TUI components, core/ for business logic, services/ for orchestration
- Use snake_case for file names (e.g., file_tree.go, template_engine.go)
- Package names must be lowercase single words

**Naming Conventions:**
- TUI Models: PascalCase with Model suffix (FileTreeModel, TemplateSelectionModel)
- Services: PascalCase with Service suffix (FileScanner, TemplateEngine)  
- Interfaces: PascalCase (Scanner, Engine, Repository)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_FILE_SIZE, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)

**Critical Rules:**
- All public functions must return error as the last return value
- Long-running operations must accept context.Context as first parameter
- Always program to interfaces for testability
- All file operations must have explicit cleanup using defer
- Never ignore errors with `_`

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Key files to create:**
- cmd/shotgun/main.go - Application entry point
- go.mod - Module definition with Go 1.22+ requirement
- go.sum - Dependency checksums (generated by go mod tidy)
- Makefile - Build automation with build/test/clean/lint targets
- .gitignore - Git exclusions for Go projects
- README.md - Project documentation
- .golangci.yml - Linter configuration
- LICENSE - Software license file

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Structure:**
- Use Go's built-in testing package for unit tests
- Test files follow *_test.go naming convention
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Place tests in same package as source code
- Use testutil/ package for shared test utilities

**Required Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for all public functions and methods
- Integration tests for multi-component workflows
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical operations
- Use teatest for TUI interaction testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Each test function must use t.Run() for subtests
- Use assert/require patterns for clear test failures
- Mock external dependencies using interfaces
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, coding-standards.md]

**Go Version:** Must be 1.22+ for generics support and performance improvements
**Cross-Platform:** Must build and run on Windows, Linux, and macOS without CGO dependencies
**Performance:** File scanning must handle 1000+ files in under 5 seconds
**Security:** All file paths must be validated against directory traversal attacks
**Memory:** Use worker pool patterns to prevent memory bottlenecks during file scanning

No specific guidance found in architecture docs for database schema or external APIs (not applicable for this foundation story).

## Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Use Go's built-in testing package
