# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Go Module Initialization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** the project properly structured with Go modules and dependencies,  
**so that** I can build and run the application consistently across platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Go module initialized with proper module path (github.com/user/shotgun-cli)
2. Project follows standard Go layout with cmd/, internal/, and templates/ directories
3. All required dependencies added to go.mod (Bubble Tea, Bubbles, Lip Gloss, Cobra, TOML parser)
4. Makefile created with build, test, and clean targets
5. Basic main.go entry point that launches Bubble Tea application
6. README.md with project description and build instructions
7. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for Go projects

  - [x] Add project description matching PRD goals
  - [x] Include build instructions using Makefile
  - [x] Add usage examples and keyboard shortcuts
  - [x] Document development setup and contribution guidelines
- [x] Initialize Git repository with Go-specific .gitignore (AC: 7)
  - [x] Run `git init` if not already initialized
  - [x] Create .gitignore with Go patterns (bin/, vendor/, *.exe, etc.)
  - [x] Add initial commit with project structure
  - [x] Verify clean git status after initial commit

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories to reference - this is the first story in the project.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Language**: Go 1.22+ for cross-platform compatibility and performance
- **TUI Framework**: Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4 implementing Elm Architecture pattern
- **UI Components**: Bubbles v0.21.0 for pre-built TUI components
- **Styling**: Lip Gloss v1.0.0 for programmatic terminal styling
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra for command-line interface structure
- **Configuration**: TOML parser for user configuration files
- **Build Tool**: Go build (native toolchain) for single binary compilation
- **Testing**: Go testing (standard library) with teatest for TUI testing

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]
- **Elm Architecture**: Single source of truth state management with immutable updates via Bubble Tea
- **Model-View-Update (MVU)**: Pure functional updates with command-based side effects
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable TUI components using Bubbles library

### Module Path Configuration
- Use placeholder module path: `github.com/user/shotgun-cli`
- This should be updated to actual GitHub repository URL when created
- Module path affects import statements and dependency resolution

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards]
- **Type Definitions**: Always define types in internal/models and import from there
- **Error Handling**: All functions that can fail must return error as last value
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always use defer for cleanup operations
- **Testing Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage for core packages
- **Panic Recovery**: Never panic in library code, only in main()

### Testing
**Test File Location**: Same directory as source files with _test.go suffix
**Test Standards**: Use Go standard testing package with table-driven tests
**Testing Framework**: Go testing (standard library) with teatest for TUI components
**Coverage Requirement**: Minimum 90% coverage for core packages
**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for file operations

### File Locations
- Main entry point: `cmd/shotgun/main.go`
- Core business logic: `internal/core/` packages
- TUI components: `internal/components/` and `internal/screens/`
- Built-in templates: `templates/` directory
- Configuration: User's `~/.config/shotgun-cli/` directory

### Dependencies Version Requirements
- Go 1.22+ minimum for modern features and performance
- Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4 for latest TUI capabilities
- Bubbles v0.21.0 for component library compatibility
- Lip Gloss v1.0.0 for stable styling API
