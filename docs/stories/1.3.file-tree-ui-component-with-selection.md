# Story 1.3: File Tree UI Component with Selection

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to navigate and select files through an interactive tree view,
**so that** I can choose which files to include in my prompt.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. File tree component displays hierarchical directory structure
2. Checkboxes render for each file/folder (all checked by default)
3. Arrow keys navigate up/down through the tree
4. Space key toggles selection for current item
5. Right/Left arrows expand/collapse directories
6. Hierarchical selection works (deselecting folder deselects all contents)
7. Visual indicators for binary files (grayed out, unselectable)
8. File count status displays at bottom (X selected, Y excluded, Z ignored)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: FileScanner with concurrent directory traversal is complete, providing FileItem data structures with IsSelected, IsBinary, IsIgnored fields. Scanner provides channel-based file streaming and binary detection capabilities.

### Tech Stack & Dependencies
- **Frontend Framework**: Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4 for TUI framework [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **UI Components**: Bubbles v0.21.0 for pre-built TUI components, including viewport [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Styling**: Lip Gloss v1.0.0 for terminal styling and programmatic styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **State Management**: Bubble Tea Models with immutable state management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Testing**: Go testing standard library, teatest for TUI flow testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Data Models
- **FileItem Structure**: Path (string), Name (string), IsDir (bool), IsSelected (bool), IsBinary (bool), IsIgnored (bool), Size (int64), Children ([]FileItem) [Source: architecture/data-models.md#fileitem]
- **FileTreeModel Structure**: items ([]FileItem), cursor (int), selected (map[string]bool), viewport (viewport.Model) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- **AppState Integration**: FileTree state will be part of central AppState for screen transitions [Source: architecture/data-models.md#appstate]

### Component Specifications
- **Standard Interface**: Update(tea.Msg) (Model, tea.Cmd), View() string, constructor pattern [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- **Message Handling**: Use tea.KeyMsg switch statements for keyboard input [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- **Viewport Integration**: Use viewport.Model for scrolling large file trees [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]

### File Locations for Implementation
- **FileTree Screen**: `internal/screens/filetree/model.go`, `update.go`, `view.go`, `keys.go` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- **Data Models**: Use existing `internal/models/file.go` for FileItem [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Styles**: `internal/styles/` for Lip Gloss styling definitions [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Testing**: Tests co-located with source files in same directory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]

### Technical Constraints

```go
// Standard key handling pattern from architecture
switch msg.String() {
case "up", "k":
    m.cursor--
case "down", "j":
    m.cursor++
case " ":
    m.toggleSelection()
case "left", "h":
    m.collapseDirectory()
case "right", "l":
    m.expandDirectory()
}
```
