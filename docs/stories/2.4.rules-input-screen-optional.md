## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 (Task Input Screen), the multiline editor system is established with:
- Complete TaskInputModel implementation at `internal/screens/input/task.go`
- Established patterns for Bubbles textarea integration with UTF-8 support
- AppState integration patterns for content persistence
- Consistent Lip Gloss styling framework across screens
- Proven clipboard operations using message-driven architecture
- Real-time character/line counting with proper rune-based counting

### Data Models
**AppState Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#appstate]:
- AppState.RulesContent (string) - User-entered rules/constraints (optional)
- AppState.CurrentScreen (ScreenType) - Current screen state tracking
- AppState.WindowSize (tea.WindowSizeMsg) - Responsive terminal sizing
- AppState.Error (error) - Error state management

**Rules Input Model Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:
- RulesInputModel struct with textarea, content, counters fields
- NewRulesInputModel() constructor function following established patterns
- Update(tea.Msg) (RulesInputModel, tea.Cmd) message handler
- View() string rendering function

### Component Specifications
**Textarea Component** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- Use Bubbles v0.21.0 textarea component for multiline input
- Configure with UTF-8 character support and validation
- Enable word wrap functionality for long lines
- Support cursor positioning and text selection capabilities

**Styling Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- Lip Gloss v1.0.0 for programmatic terminal styling
- Consistent styling patterns with task input screen
- Clear "Optional" visual indicators in header/title
- Character/line count display with proper visual hierarchy

### API Specifications
**Clipboard Integration**:
- Reuse clipboard patterns from task input implementation
- Platform-specific clipboard operations (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Ctrl+C for copy selected text functionality
- Ctrl+V for paste from system clipboard
- Graceful error handling for clipboard access failures

**UTF-8 Character Support** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Full international character support for rules input
- Proper character counting (not byte counting) for display
- UTF-8 validation and error handling
- Cross-platform character encoding consistency

### File Locations
**Screen Components** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `internal/screens/input/rules.go` - RulesInputModel state structure
- `internal/screens/input/update.go` - Enhanced for rules handling (or separate rules_update.go)
- `internal/screens/input/view.go` - Enhanced for rules rendering (or separate rules_view.go)
- May reuse editor patterns from task input implementation

**Testing Files** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]:
- Tests co-located: `rules_test.go`
- Reuse testdata from task input: `internal/screens/input/testdata/`

### Technical Constraints
**Optional Screen Behavior** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#protected-route-pattern]:
- F4 key must skip screen entirely, bypassing validation
- F3 advances regardless of content (no validation required)
- Screen can be empty without preventing advancement
- State must persist when navigating back from confirmation screen

**State Management** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]:
- Immutable state updates through Bubble Tea message pattern
- AppState.RulesContent as single source of truth for rules input
- Message-based communication between screen and global state
- Content preservation during navigation and screen skipping

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- All functions that can fail must return error as last value
- Use tea.Cmd pattern for async clipboard operations
- Handle UTF-8 encoding errors gracefully with user messages
- Graceful handling of clipboard operation failures

### Screen Flow Integration
**Routing Logic** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]:
- TaskInput → RulesInput (normal flow)
- TaskInput → Confirmation (F4 skip from rules screen)
- RulesInput → Confirmation (F3 advance)
- RulesInput → TaskInput (F2 back)

**Skip Functionality**:
- F4 from task input screen should advance to confirmation, bypassing rules
- F4 from rules input screen should advance to confirmation
- AppState.RulesContent remains empty when screen is skipped
- Confirmation screen should handle both scenarios (with/without rules)

### Testing Requirements
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]:
- Unit tests co-located with source files in `internal/screens/input/`
- Minimum 90% coverage requirement for core screen logic
- Reuse established testing patterns from task input screen

**Test Scenarios**:
- Multiline text input and editing functionality
- Optional screen behavior (empty content allowed)
- Screen skipping with F4 key from both task and rules screens
- Keyboard navigation (F2, F3, F4) and state preservation
- Clipboard operations (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V) with UTF-8 support
- Character and line counting functionality
- Screen flow integration with other screens
- State persistence when navigating between screens
- Error handling for edge cases

### Integration Points
**AppState Connection**:
- Add RulesContent field to AppState structure
- Update AppState.RulesContent on every text change
- Handle screen skipping logic in main app controller
- Ensure proper routing between screens

**Screen Relationship**:
- Similar component structure to TaskInputModel
- Reuse styling patterns and message handling approaches
- Integrate with existing screen transition validation logic
- Ensure consistent user experience across input screens

## Testing
Test files must be co-located with source files in `internal/screens/input/`:
- `rules_test.go` - State management and textarea functionality tests
- Include comprehensive testing for optional behavior and screen skipping
- Test coverage minimum 90% for core screen logic
- Reuse testdata/ subdirectory from task input for UTF-8 test cases
- Use Go testing standard library with teatest for TUI-specific testing
