# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: N/A (terminal application)
- XSS Prevention: N/A (no web content)
- Secure Storage: Respect OS file permissions

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Validate all file paths and user input
- Rate Limiting: N/A (local application)
- CORS Policy: N/A (no web API)

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: N/A (no authentication)
- Session Management: N/A (stateless application)
- Password Policy: N/A (no user accounts)

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <20MB binary
- Loading Strategy: Immediate with <2s startup
- Caching Strategy: In-memory file metadata cache

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <16ms for UI updates
- Database Optimization: Concurrent file scanning with worker pools
- Caching Strategy: sync.Map for thread-safe caching
