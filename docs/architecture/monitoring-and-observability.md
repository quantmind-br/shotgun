# Monitoring and Observability

### Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Built-in TUI performance metrics and user interaction tracking
- **Backend Monitoring:** Go runtime metrics, operation timing, and resource usage tracking  
- **Error Tracking:** Structured logging with error categorization and local log files
- **Performance Monitoring:** Built-in profiling support with Go's pprof integration

### Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Screen render times and frame rates
- User interaction response times  
- Memory usage during UI operations
- TUI component load times

**Backend Metrics:**
- File scanning throughput (files/second)
- Template processing latency
- Memory allocation patterns
- Goroutine count and lifecycle

**Application Metrics:**
- Session duration and completion rates
- File selection patterns and sizes
- Template usage statistics
- Error frequencies by category
