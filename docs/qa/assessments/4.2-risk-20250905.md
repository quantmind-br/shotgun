## Risk Mitigation Details

### PERF-001: Animation Performance Degradation
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Profile animation performance during development
- Implement frame skip logic when behind schedule
- Add configuration for animation speed/disable
- Use buffered rendering to reduce flicker
**Testing Requirements**:
- Load testing with large file trees (10K+ files)
- Performance profiling on low-end hardware
- FPS monitoring during animations

### TECH-001: Terminal Compatibility Issues
**Strategy**: Detective & Corrective
**Actions**:
- Create terminal capability matrix
- Implement feature detection at runtime
- Provide graceful degradation path
- Document minimum terminal requirements
**Testing Requirements**:
- Test matrix covering all target terminals
- Automated cross-platform CI testing
- Manual verification of visual output

### TECH-002: Concurrent Animation Race Conditions
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Use proper synchronization for shared state
- Implement mutex locks for animation updates
- Test concurrent progress updates thoroughly
**Testing Requirements**:
- Concurrent operation stress tests
- Race condition detection tools
- Unit tests for state management

### PERF-002: Memory Leaks from Ticker Resources
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Ensure all tickers are properly stopped
- Implement cleanup in defer statements
- Monitor memory usage during long operations
**Testing Requirements**:
- Memory leak detection tests
- Long-running operation tests
- Resource cleanup verification

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Cross-platform terminal compatibility testing
- Animation performance benchmarking
- Concurrent operation stress testing
- Memory leak detection

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Progress calculation accuracy verification
- State synchronization tests
- Error handling for edge cases
- Cancellation mechanism testing

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Visual consistency checks
- Standard unit tests
- Integration tests with existing components

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Terminal compatibility must work on 95% of target terminals
- Animation performance must maintain 30+ FPS minimum

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Minor visual inconsistencies with documented workarounds
- Performance degradation with disable option available

### Accepted Risks
- Some exotic terminal emulators may have display issues
- Animations may stutter on very low-end systems

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Frame rate metrics during animations
- Memory usage patterns during long operations
- Error rates for terminal rendering issues
- User feedback on animation performance

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New terminal types are added to support matrix
- Performance issues are reported by users
- Memory leaks are detected in production
- Animation framework is updated
