## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: Memory Exhaustion from Large Files

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - Large files (logs, binaries, generated code) are common in software projects  
**Impact**: High - Application crash, system instability, poor user experience  
**Mitigation**:

- Implement configurable max file size limits (default 10MB)
- Use io.LimitReader to cap memory usage per file  
- Stream file content in fixed-size chunks (4KB buffers)
- Add memory usage monitoring and early termination
- **Testing Focus**: Load tests with files up to 100MB, memory profiling, stress testing

### 2. DATA-002: Sensitive File Content Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - Developers commonly have API keys, passwords, certificates in project files  
**Impact**: High - Credential exposure, potential security breach, compliance violations  
**Mitigation**:

- Implement sensitive file detection (`.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `config/*`)
- Add user confirmation prompt for suspicious files
- Provide file preview/summary before full inclusion  
- Add opt-in mode for sensitive file directories
- **Testing Focus**: Test with common sensitive file patterns, manual validation scenarios

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Memory Management Tests (PERF-001)**:
- Load tests with files ranging 1MB to 100MB
- Memory usage profiling during large file processing
- Concurrent processing of multiple large files
- Memory leak detection over extended operations
- System resource monitoring during peak usage

**Sensitive File Detection Tests (DATA-002)**:
- Test detection of common sensitive file patterns (.env, *.key, *.pem, etc.)
- False positive/negative testing with edge case filenames
- User confirmation workflow testing
- File preview functionality validation
- Opt-in/opt-out behavior verification

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Concurrency Control Tests (TECH-001)**:
- Stress testing with 1000+ files
- Goroutine leak detection
- Worker pool saturation testing  
- Resource cleanup verification
- Context cancellation behavior

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**XML Escaping Tests (TECH-003)**:
- Special character handling (quotes, angle brackets, control characters)
- Unicode character preservation
- Binary data handling edge cases

**Standard Functional Tests**:
- Tree visualization accuracy
- Binary file detection
- File I/O error handling
- Context cancellation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **PERF-001**: Memory exhaustion protection - CRITICAL
- **DATA-002**: Sensitive file detection/warning - CRITICAL
- **TECH-001**: Goroutine pool limits - HIGH

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **TECH-003**: XML escaping - Acceptable with thorough testing
- **PERF-003**: I/O bottleneck - Acceptable with monitoring
- **DATA-001**: Content corruption - Acceptable with validation

### Accepted Risks

- **SEC-001, SEC-002**: Low probability security risks acceptable for local CLI tool
- **PERF-002**: Deep directory performance acceptable with reasonable limits
- **OPS-001**: Binary detection false negatives acceptable with user review

## Monitoring Requirements

**Post-deployment monitoring for:**

- **Performance metrics**: Memory usage, file processing times, concurrent operation counts
- **Error rates**: File read failures, XML parsing errors, goroutine panics  
- **User behavior**: Large file processing frequency, sensitive file encounters
- **Resource usage**: Peak memory consumption, I/O throughput, system load

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- File size limits are changed or removed
- New file types or processing logic added  
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in file processing
- Concurrency model changes (worker pool modifications)
- User reports of sensitive data exposure

## Recommendations Summary

### Must Implement
1. **File size limits and streaming** (PERF-001)
2. **Sensitive file detection** (DATA-002)  
3. **Goroutine pool controls** (TECH-001)

### Should Implement  
4. **Robust XML escaping** (TECH-003)
5. **I/O backpressure handling** (PERF-003)

### Monitor in Production
6. **Memory usage patterns**
7. **File processing performance**  
8. **User behavior with sensitive files**

**Overall Assessment**: Moderate risk story requiring careful implementation of critical performance and security controls. With proper mitigation, risks are manageable for MVP deployment.
