## Critical/High Risk Analysis

**No critical or high risks identified.** This foundation story follows established Go conventions and uses well-documented frameworks.

## Medium Risk: TECH-001 - Dependency Version Conflicts

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Beta versions can have breaking changes  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could block development progress  

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Using Bubble Tea v2.0.0-beta.4 (pre-release version)
- Multiple UI framework dependencies with version interdependencies
- Potential for API changes before stable release

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test all dependencies together during initial setup
- Pin exact versions in go.mod file
- Monitor Bubble Tea release notes for breaking changes
- Have fallback plan to stable v1 if needed

**Testing Focus**:
- Integration tests with all UI dependencies
- Build verification on target platforms
- Dependency resolution testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Dependency Integration Tests
- **Test Scenario**: Verify all specified dependencies install and compile together
- **Success Criteria**: Clean `go mod tidy` and successful `go build`
- **Test Data**: Fresh Go module environment

### Priority 2: Build System Validation
- **Test Scenario**: Execute all Makefile targets on different platforms
- **Success Criteria**: All targets (build, test, clean) execute without errors
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows (if supported)

### Priority 3: Standard Go Practices Validation  
- **Test Scenario**: Verify project structure follows Go conventions
- **Success Criteria**: `go vet`, `go fmt`, and `go mod verify` pass
- **Tools**: Standard Go toolchain validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **TECH-001**: Dependency conflicts must be resolved
- All dependencies must build successfully together

### Can Deploy with Monitoring
- **OPS-001**: Build system issues can be resolved during development
- **TECH-002**: Go version compatibility verified on target environments

### Accepted Risks
- **BUS-001**: Minor deviation from project structure acceptable if documented
- **TECH-003**: Cross-platform issues can be addressed iteratively

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-implementation monitoring for:
- **Dependency Updates**: Track Bubble Tea v2 stable release
- **Build Success**: Monitor CI/CD build success rates across platforms
- **Developer Onboarding**: Track setup time and failure rates for new developers

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Bubble Tea v2 reaches stable release
- Additional dependencies added to project
- Cross-platform deployment requirements change
- Build system becomes more complex

## Risk-Based Development Recommendations

### Development Focus Areas
1. **Early Integration Testing**: Set up dependencies immediately and test compatibility
2. **Build Validation**: Test Makefile on multiple environments early
3. **Documentation**: Clearly document version requirements and setup steps

### Testing Priorities
1. Dependency resolution and compatibility testing (highest priority)
2. Build system validation across platforms
3. Standard Go toolchain compliance verification

### Deployment Strategy
- **Low Risk Deployment**: Standard deployment practices sufficient
- **No Phased Rollout Required**: Foundation story with minimal user impact
- **Rollback Plan**: Simple - revert to previous project state if needed

## Quality Gate Recommendation

**Gate Status: PASS** âœ…

**Rationale**: 
- No critical or high risks identified
- Single medium risk has clear mitigation strategy  
- Foundation story with well-established patterns
- Risk score of 87/100 indicates low overall risk

**Conditions**:
- Dependency integration testing must be completed
- Build system must be validated on target platforms
- All identified mitigations must be implemented

## Conclusion

Story 1.1 presents a **low-risk implementation** with excellent preparation quality. The risk profile supports immediate development with standard monitoring practices. Primary focus should be on dependency management and cross-platform build validation.

**Overall Risk Assessment: LOW** 
**Implementation Confidence: HIGH**
**Recommended Action: PROCEED**
