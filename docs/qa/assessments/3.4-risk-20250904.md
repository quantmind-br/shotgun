## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*None identified - all risks manageable with proper implementation*

## High Priority Risks

### TECH-001: File System I/O Operation Failures

**Score: 6 (High Priority)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - File system issues occur regularly in production environments  
**Impact**: High (3) - Failed file writes could lose user work and create severe UX degradation

**Risk Details**:
- User could lose generated prompt content if write operations fail
- Poor error handling could leave application in inconsistent state  
- Cross-platform file system differences could cause unexpected failures
- Disk space exhaustion or permission issues could prevent successful saves

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Implement atomic file operations using temp file → rename pattern (specified in story)
- ✅ Add comprehensive disk space validation before write operations  
- ✅ Implement detailed error messages for different failure types (permissions, space, locks)
- ✅ Add retry mechanism for recoverable errors like temporary file locks
- ✅ Validate write permissions before attempting file operations

**Testing Focus**:
- Test write failures across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Simulate disk full conditions and verify graceful handling
- Test write operations with various permission configurations
- Verify atomic operation rollback on partial failures
- Test filename collision detection with concurrent operations

## Medium Priority Risks

### PERF-001: Memory Exhaustion with Large Outputs

**Score: 4 (Medium Priority)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Large file sets explicitly mentioned as use case  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could cause application crash but without data corruption

**Risk Details**:
- Very large file sets could consume excessive memory during generation
- Template processing with large variable content could cause memory spikes  
- File structure assembly might load too many files simultaneously
- Progress tracking might accumulate excessive state during long operations

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Implement streaming writes for very large outputs (specified in story)
- Add memory usage monitoring and warning thresholds
- Implement chunked processing for large file sets
- Add progress cancellation to prevent resource exhaustion
- Use context cancellation for responsive memory cleanup

### TECH-002: Concurrent Access Race Conditions

**Score: 4 (Medium Priority)**  
**Probability**: Low (2) - Single-user application but uses goroutines  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could cause application instability or file corruption

**Risk Details**:
- Async generation goroutines could race with UI state updates
- Bubble Tea command system might have timing issues with long operations
- File writing and UI progress updates could conflict
- Context cancellation might not properly clean up all goroutines

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Implement proper goroutine cleanup on cancellation (specified in story)
- ✅ Use channels for safe communication between UI and generation
- ✅ Add context cancellation support throughout pipeline  
- ✅ Ensure atomic operations for all file writes
- Implement proper synchronization for shared state access

## Low Priority Risks

### DATA-001: Template Processing Injection  

**Score: 3 (Low Priority)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Local application with controlled template sources  
**Impact**: High (3) - Could potentially execute malicious code through template functions

**Risk Details**:
- Template functions could be exploited if templates come from untrusted sources
- Variable substitution might allow injection of malicious content
- Template processing errors could expose system information
- File path variables could potentially enable path traversal

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Sanitize all template variables before processing
- Validate template function calls against allowlist  
- Use safe template execution context with restricted capabilities
- Validate file paths to prevent traversal attacks
- Limit available template functions to safe operations only

### OPS-001: Insufficient Error Context for Debugging

**Score: 2 (Low Priority)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Story includes comprehensive error handling guidance  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Poor error messages could delay troubleshooting

**Risk Details**:
- Generic error messages might not provide enough context for resolution
- File system errors might not include sufficient path/permission information  
- Generation failures might not clearly indicate which stage failed
- Progress tracking failures might not provide clear recovery guidance

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Include full context in error messages (specified in story)  
- Add structured logging for generation pipeline stages
- Implement error categorization with specific recovery suggestions
- Provide actionable guidance in all user-facing error messages
