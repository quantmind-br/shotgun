## Conclusion

The shotgun-cli-v3 project presents moderate risk levels with two critical security/data concerns requiring immediate attention. The use of proven technologies (Go, Bubble Tea) and well-defined architecture helps mitigate technical risks, but the nature of processing user file content and terminal output creates inherent security challenges.

Successful risk mitigation will depend on:
1. Implementing robust security controls for terminal output and template processing
2. Establishing comprehensive testing across platforms and use cases  
3. Creating effective monitoring and error handling systems
4. Maintaining focus on user data protection and privacy

With proper mitigation of critical risks, the project can achieve its goals while maintaining acceptable risk levels for a developer productivity tool.
