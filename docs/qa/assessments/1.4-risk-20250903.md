## High Priority Risks Requiring Mitigation

### 1. TECH-001: State Management Complexity

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex AppState with 5 screen models and shared data persistence  
**Impact**: High (3) - State corruption would break entire navigation system

**Risk Details**:
- AppState manages multiple screen models with complex relationships
- State persistence across forward/backward navigation cycles
- Potential for race conditions during rapid screen transitions
- Shared data management (SelectedFiles, TaskContent, etc.) across screens

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ **Immediate Actions Required**:
  - Implement comprehensive state validation in AppState constructor
  - Add state integrity checks during all screen transitions  
  - Use immutable state patterns consistently per Bubble Tea architecture
  - Create defensive programming patterns for state access

- ✅ **Testing Focus**: 
  - Unit tests for all state transition scenarios (forward/backward/skip)
  - Property-based testing for state invariants
  - Integration tests with rapid navigation sequences
  - Edge case testing for incomplete data scenarios

**Components Affected**: `internal/app/model.go`, all screen transition logic

## Medium Priority Risks

### 2. TECH-002: Key Handler Conflicts

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Multiple key handling layers create conflict potential  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Navigation failures would degrade UX but not break system

**Mitigation**:
- Implement clear key routing hierarchy (global → screen-specific)
- Add key handler priority documentation and validation
- Test all key combinations across all screen states

### 3. BUS-001: User Experience Degradation  

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex validation logic with user-facing impacts  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Poor UX could affect user adoption

**Mitigation**:
- Design user-friendly validation error messages
- Implement progressive validation feedback
- Create consistent error messaging patterns across all screens

---

## Low Priority Risks

### 4. TECH-003: Focus Management Race Conditions

**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**  
Well-defined Bubble Tea patterns make this unlikely, but proper focus restoration testing recommended.

### 5. OPS-001: Integration Complexity

**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**  
Story 1.3 integration risk mitigated by excellent completion documentation and clear interface definitions.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (TECH-001)

**State Management Testing**:
- **State Transition Matrix Testing**: Test all possible navigation paths between 5 screens
- **Rapid Navigation Testing**: Stress test with fast F2/F3 key sequences
- **State Persistence Testing**: Verify data preservation across navigation cycles
- **Concurrent Access Testing**: Validate state integrity under concurrent operations
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test with partial data, validation failures, interrupted flows

**Required Test Types**:
- Unit tests for AppState constructor and validation
- Property-based tests for state invariants  
- Integration tests for multi-screen workflows
- Stress tests for rapid navigation sequences

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

**Key Handler Testing** (TECH-002):
- Test global key routing with all screen states
- Validate key precedence rules
- Test edge cases with rapid key sequences

**User Experience Testing** (BUS-001):
- Validation message clarity and consistency
- Error handling workflow testing
- User journey testing with validation failures

### Priority 3: Standard Testing

**Focus Management**: Standard focus restoration testing
**Integration**: FileTree compatibility validation  
**Performance**: Memory usage monitoring during navigation

---

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- ✅ **TECH-001**: State management complexity must be mitigated with comprehensive validation and testing
- All state transition scenarios must be thoroughly tested
- State integrity checks must be implemented

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-002**: Key handler conflicts - acceptable with documented routing rules and integration testing
- **BUS-001**: UX degradation - acceptable with user-friendly error messaging implementation

### Accepted Risks
- **TECH-003**: Focus management race conditions - low probability, standard patterns mitigate
- **OPS-001**: Integration complexity - well-documented interfaces reduce risk
- **PERF-001**: Memory leaks - Go GC and defer patterns provide adequate protection

---

## Monitoring Requirements

### Post-Implementation Monitoring
- **State Management**: Monitor for state corruption errors, navigation failures
- **Key Handling**: Track key routing conflicts, unhandled key events
- **User Experience**: Monitor validation failure rates, error message effectiveness
- **Performance**: Track memory usage patterns, screen transition timing
- **Integration**: Monitor FileTree compatibility, state sync issues

### Key Metrics to Track
- Navigation success rates by screen transition
- Validation failure rates and recovery
- User workflow completion rates
- System responsiveness during navigation
- Error message clarity scores (user feedback)

## Risk Review Triggers

Update this risk profile when:
- Additional screens are added to the wizard flow
- Key binding requirements change
- State management patterns are modified  
- User feedback indicates UX issues
- Performance issues are reported during navigation
- Integration requirements with other components change

## Quality Gate Integration

**Risk-Based Gate Decision**: 
- **Gate Status**: **CONCERNS** (due to 1 high-priority risk)
- **Blocker**: None - high risk can be mitigated through implementation practices
- **Requirements**: State management mitigation must be implemented before production deployment

**Deterministic Mapping**:
- High risk (score 6) → Gate = CONCERNS
- Requires mitigation plan for TECH-001 before final approval
- All other risks acceptable with standard development practices
