## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

**None identified** - No critical risks found for this story.

## Medium Risk Items Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-002: State Synchronization Complexity

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Complex dual-state management between `selected` map and `FileItem.IsSelected`  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could cause selection inconsistencies and user confusion  

**Mitigation:**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for state transitions
- Create state validation functions in FileTreeModel
- Use single source of truth pattern for selection state
- Add invariant checks in development builds

**Testing Focus:** State machine testing with teatest, property-based testing for selection logic

### 2. PERF-001: Memory Usage with Large Directories

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Large projects could have thousands of files  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could cause memory pressure but not application crashes  

**Mitigation:**
- Implement lazy loading for file tree nodes
- Use streaming approach from Scanner service  
- Implement viewport-based rendering (only visible items)
- Add memory usage monitoring in tests

**Testing Focus:** Load testing with large directory structures (1000+ files)

### 3. OPS-001: TUI Testing Complexity

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - TUI testing is inherently more complex than standard unit tests  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could reduce test coverage and miss UI bugs  

**Mitigation:**
- Use teatest library for TUI-specific testing
- Create test fixtures and utilities for common scenarios
- Implement snapshot testing for view rendering
- Add integration tests with real terminal dimensions

**Testing Focus:** Comprehensive test suite targeting 90% coverage with TUI-specific scenarios

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

**State Management Tests (TECH-002):**
- Test selection state synchronization between map and FileItem objects
- Test hierarchical selection propagation (parent -> children)
- Test edge cases: rapid selection changes, concurrent state updates
- Property-based testing for selection invariants

**Performance Tests (PERF-001):**
- Load testing with 1000+ file directory structures
- Memory profiling during tree rendering and navigation
- Viewport performance with deep directory hierarchies
- Stress testing with rapid navigation and selection changes

**TUI Testing Coverage (OPS-001):**
- Comprehensive keyboard navigation test scenarios
- Terminal dimension variation testing
- Visual regression testing with snapshot comparisons
- Integration testing with real Scanner service data

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

**Integration Tests:**
- FileTree to Scanner service integration
- Screen transition testing (F3 to next screen)
- AppState integration verification

**User Experience Tests:**
- Keyboard navigation usability testing
- Visual indicator verification for binary files
- Status bar accuracy under various selection scenarios

### Priority 3: Minimal Risk Tests

**Basic Functional Tests:**
- Standard Bubble Tea component lifecycle
