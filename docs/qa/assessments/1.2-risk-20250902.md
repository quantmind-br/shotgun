Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Medium Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 40/100 (High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [PERF-001]: Goroutine Resource Exhaustion

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Directory scanning with unlimited goroutine spawning is a common source of resource exhaustion
**Impact**: High - Can crash the application, exhaust system memory, cause DoS conditions
**Mitigation**:

- Implement worker pool with configurable limit (default: runtime.NumCPU())
- Use semaphore or bounded channel to limit concurrent directory operations
- Add context cancellation to prevent runaway goroutines
- Implement graceful shutdown with timeout for cleanup
- Monitor goroutine count in production

**Testing Focus**: Load testing with massive directory structures, chaos testing with cancelled contexts, memory leak detection

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Goroutine Leak Testing**: Monitor goroutine count during and after large directory scans
- **Resource Exhaustion Testing**: Test with directories containing 100K+ files
- **Cancellation Testing**: Verify proper cleanup when operations are cancelled
- **Worker Pool Limits**: Validate that worker pool respects configured limits

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Path Traversal Security Tests**: Test with malicious paths (../, symlinks, absolute paths)
- **Memory Pressure Testing**: Monitor memory usage during scanning of large codebases
- **Concurrent Access Tests**: Multiple scanners running simultaneously
- **Race Condition Detection**: Use race detector in testing (-race flag)

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests

- **Permission Denied Handling**: Test with restricted directories and files
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security scans of doublestar/filetype
- **Error Propagation Testing**: Verify error handling through concurrent channels

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- PERF-001: Goroutine resource exhaustion (Critical)
- SEC-001: Path traversal vulnerability (High)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-002: Memory exhaustion with monitoring and limits in place
- OPS-001: Race conditions with comprehensive testing and race detector

### Accepted Risks

- TECH-001: Third-party dependencies with regular security scanning
- DATA-001: Permission handling with proper error reporting

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: Goroutine count, memory usage, scan duration
- **Security Alerts**: Suspicious path access attempts, permission escalations
- **Error Rates**: Permission denied errors, scan failures, timeout errors
- **Resource Usage**: CPU utilization during concurrent scans

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Worker pool implementation changes
- New concurrency patterns added
- File system access patterns modified
- Third-party dependencies updated
- Performance issues reported in production

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### PERF-001: Goroutine Resource Exhaustion
- **Root Cause**: Unlimited goroutine spawning in directory traversal
- **Affected Components**: Scanner core, concurrent.go worker pool
- **Detection Method**: Code analysis revealed missing worker pool limits
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement bounded worker pool with semaphore pattern
- **Residual Risk**: Medium - Implementation complexity may introduce new bugs
- **Owner**: Development team
- **Timeline**: Must be implemented before initial deployment

### SEC-001: Path Traversal Vulnerability
- **Root Cause**: User-controlled root path without validation
- **Affected Components**: Scanner constructor, path validation
- **Detection Method**: Security analysis of input handling

### PERF-002: Memory Exhaustion from Large Directories
- **Root Cause**: Buffered channel (cap 100) may not be sufficient for very large directories
- **Affected Components**: Channel-based file streaming
- **Detection Method**: Analysis of memory usage patterns in large codebases
