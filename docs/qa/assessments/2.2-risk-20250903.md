## Risk Details

### TECH-001: Bubble Tea Framework Integration Complexity (Score: 4)
**Probability**: Medium - Complex state management patterns can be challenging to implement correctly
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause UI freezes or inconsistent behavior
**Mitigation**:
- Follow established Bubble Tea patterns from architecture docs
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for all message handlers
- Use immutable state updates exclusively
- Test concurrent message handling scenarios
**Testing Focus**: State transition tests, concurrent message handling, error boundary testing

### PERF-001: Large Template List Rendering (Score: 4)  
**Probability**: Medium - Users may have many custom templates
**Impact**: Medium - UI lag could degrade user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Implement virtual scrolling with Bubbles viewport component
- Lazy load template metadata
- Add performance benchmarks for large lists
- Consider pagination for 100+ templates
**Testing Focus**: Performance tests with large datasets, memory usage monitoring

### BUS-001: User Experience Confusion (Score: 4)
**Probability**: Medium - Terminal UIs can be unfamiliar to some users
**Impact**: Medium - Poor UX could reduce tool adoption
**Mitigation**:
- Provide clear visual feedback for selected items
- Use consistent keyboard shortcuts across screens
- Add contextual help indicators
- Follow established TUI conventions
**Testing Focus**: Usability testing, keyboard navigation flows, visual feedback validation

### TECH-002: Template Service Dependency (Score: 3)
**Probability**: Low - Story 2.1 passed comprehensive QA review
**Impact**: High - Complete feature failure if service fails
**Mitigation**:
- Implement defensive error handling for all service calls
- Add graceful degradation for service failures
- Mock service layer for independent testing
- Add service health checks
**Testing Focus**: Error scenario testing, service failure simulation

### DATA-001: State Preservation Failure (Score: 3)
**Probability**: Low - Well-established patterns in architecture
**Impact**: High - Loss of user selections would be frustrating
**Mitigation**:
- Test all screen transition scenarios thoroughly
- Implement proper AppState integration
- Add state validation checks
- Document state preservation requirements
**Testing Focus**: Screen navigation tests, state persistence validation

### SEC-001: Template Metadata Display (Score: 2)
**Probability**: Low - Limited attack surface in local-only application
**Impact**: Medium - Terminal escape injection could affect display
**Mitigation**:
- Sanitize all template metadata before display
- Escape terminal control sequences
- Validate template content structure
- Add input validation to template loading
**Testing Focus**: Content injection tests, escape sequence handling
