**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Story**: 4.1 - Global Keyboard Navigation System

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 6
- **Critical Risks**: 0
- **High Risks**: 2  
- **Medium Risks**: 2
- **Low Risks**: 2
- **Risk Score**: 66/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High Priority Risks Requiring Attention

### TECH-001: Key Event Handling Race Conditions

**Score: 6 (High Priority)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Bubble Tea framework generally handles concurrency well, but complex global/local key interaction patterns could create edge cases  
**Impact**: High (3) - Race conditions could cause complete navigation failure, duplicate actions, or missed key events that break core functionality

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement proper key event sequencing with clear priority rules (global handler first, then local)
- Add comprehensive integration tests for rapid key press scenarios
- Use Go's channels and proper synchronization for key event processing
- Implement defensive programming with proper error handling for key conflicts

**Testing Focus**:
- Stress test with rapid F-key sequences across screen transitions
- Test concurrent global + local key events (e.g., F3 while typing in text field)
- Verify proper event bubbling and cancellation behavior

### TECH-003: Cross-Platform Terminal Compatibility

**Score: 6 (High Priority)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Known variability in terminal key code handling across Windows CMD, PowerShell, macOS Terminal, Linux terminals  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - F-key shortcuts may not work consistently, degrading user experience but not breaking core functionality

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement terminal capability detection and fallback key mappings
- Test on all target platforms (Windows CMD/PowerShell, macOS Terminal/iTerm2, common Linux terminals)
- Add graceful degradation for terminals with limited F-key support
- Document known terminal compatibility issues and workarounds

**Testing Focus**:
- Multi-platform testing matrix for F1-F10 key detection
- Terminal capability detection accuracy testing
- Fallback behavior validation for limited terminals

## Medium Priority Risks

### TECH-002: Bubble Tea Integration Complexity

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex state management between help overlay, global handlers, and screen components  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Integration bugs could cause UI rendering issues or inconsistent behavior

**Mitigation**: Comprehensive component integration testing, clear state management patterns

### BUS-001: Accessibility Compliance  

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Accessibility often overlooked in keyboard navigation implementations  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could exclude users with disabilities, potential compliance issues

**Mitigation**: Screen reader testing, WCAG guideline review, logical tab order implementation

## Low Priority Risks

### OPS-001: User Learning Curve

**Score: 3 (Low)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Users often don't discover or remember keyboard shortcuts  
**Impact**: Low (1) - Reduces efficiency but doesn't break functionality

**Mitigation**: Comprehensive help system with F1 overlay, clear documentation

### DATA-001: State Management Corruption

**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Go's concurrency model provides good protection  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could lose user selections but not critical system data

**Mitigation**: Proper state synchronization, defensive programming practices

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- **Technical**: 3 risks (2 high, 1 medium)
- **Business**: 1 risk (1 medium)  
- **Operational**: 1 risk (1 low)
- **Data**: 1 risk (1 low)
- **Security**: 0 risks
- **Performance**: 0 risks

### By Component
- **Global Key Handler**: 2 risks
- **Help Overlay System**: 1 risk
- **Screen Integration**: 2 risks
- **Cross-Platform**: 1 risk

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (Must Execute)

**Key Event Handling (TECH-001)**:
- Rapid key press sequences (F1→F3→ESC within 100ms)
- Concurrent global/local key events during text input
- Screen transition stress testing with key event validation
- Edge case: Multiple F-key presses before screen fully loads

**Cross-Platform Compatibility (TECH-003)**:
- F1-F10 detection on Windows CMD, PowerShell, WSL
- macOS Terminal and iTerm2 compatibility testing  
- Linux terminal variations (gnome-terminal, xterm, konsole)
- Terminal capability detection accuracy validation

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

**Integration Testing (TECH-002)**:
- Help overlay + screen component interaction
- State preservation during help toggle
- Component lifecycle during navigation

**Accessibility Testing (BUS-001)**:
- Screen reader navigation flow
- Tab order validation across all screens
- Keyboard-only navigation completeness

### Priority 3: Standard Tests

- Functional acceptance criteria validation
- Basic navigation flow testing
- Help system content accuracy
- User experience flow testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **TECH-001**: Key event race conditions resolved and tested
- **TECH-003**: Core F-key functionality working on primary platforms (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-002**: Integration issues with compensating manual testing
- **BUS-001**: Basic accessibility with improvement roadmap

### Accepted Risks
- **OPS-001**: User learning curve (inherent UX challenge)
- **DATA-001**: Minimal state corruption risk (Go concurrency protection)

## Monitoring Requirements

**Post-deployment monitoring**:
- Error rates for key event processing failures
- User adoption metrics for keyboard shortcuts vs mouse navigation
- Terminal compatibility issue reports from users
- Help system usage analytics

## Risk Review Triggers

Update this risk profile when:
- Additional F-key functionality added
- New terminal platforms supported
- User feedback indicates navigation issues
- Integration with external systems requiring keyboard handling

## Quality Gate Recommendation

**Gate Decision**: **CONCERNS** - Deploy with high-priority risk mitigation required

**Rationale**: Two high-priority risks need attention but don't block deployment if properly tested. Strong architectural foundation with well-documented risks and mitigation strategies.
