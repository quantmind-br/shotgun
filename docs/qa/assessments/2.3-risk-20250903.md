## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

**None identified** - This story shows well-managed risk profile with good architectural planning.

## High Risk Items

### 1. TECH-001: Cross-Platform Clipboard Integration Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Different OS clipboard APIs are a known complexity  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could cause feature failure on some platforms but workarounds exist

**Risk Details**:
- Windows uses different clipboard APIs than Unix-like systems
- Permission models vary (some Linux distributions require additional permissions)
- Different clipboard data formats across platforms
- Limited Go standard library support for advanced clipboard operations

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- **Preventive Actions**:
  - Research and select proven cross-platform clipboard library (e.g., `github.com/atotto/clipboard`)
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for systems without clipboard access
  - Add platform detection and specific handling for each OS
  - Create abstraction layer for clipboard operations

**Testing Requirements**:
- Manual testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Automated tests with clipboard mocking
- Test clipboard permission scenarios
- Test with empty clipboard and large clipboard content

**Residual Risk**: Low - With proper library selection and testing, risk becomes manageable

## Medium Risk Items

### 2. TECH-002: UTF-8 Character Handling Edge Cases  

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex characters are common in international usage  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could cause display issues but not system failure

**Risk Details**:
- Emoji and complex Unicode characters have variable display widths
- RTL (Right-to-Left) text like Arabic/Hebrew creates layout challenges
- Combining characters (accents, diacritics) affect character counting
- Terminal font support varies for Unicode characters

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Use proper Unicode-aware character counting (rune counting, not byte counting)
- Test with comprehensive Unicode character sets
- Handle zero-width and double-width characters correctly
- Implement graceful fallbacks for unsupported characters

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test with emoji, complex scripts, RTL text
- Verify character counting accuracy with Unicode test data
- Test word wrap with mixed character widths
- Validate display on various terminal types

### 3. DATA-001: State Persistence Race Conditions

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Rapid navigation is common user behavior  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could cause data loss but recoverable

**Risk Details**:
- Rapid F2/F3 navigation might interrupt state synchronization
- AppState.TaskContent updates could be lost during screen transitions
- Tea command async operations might complete after screen change
- Race conditions between user input and state persistence

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement immediate state persistence on every text change
- Use synchronous updates for critical state changes
- Add debouncing for rapid state updates
- Validate state consistency during screen transitions

**Testing Requirements**:
- Stress test rapid navigation scenarios
- Test concurrent state updates
- Validate state persistence across transitions
- Test with simulated slow I/O conditions

## Low Risk Items

### 4. PERF-001: Real-time Character Counting Performance

**Score: 3 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Large text inputs uncommon for task descriptions  
**Impact**: High (3) - Could cause UI freezing if it occurs

**Mitigation**: Implement debouncing for count updates, optimize counting algorithms

### 5. BUS-001: User Experience Degradation on Small Terminals

**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Small terminals uncommon for development workflows  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could make interface unusable but affects few users

**Mitigation**: Implement responsive layout with minimum size requirements, graceful degradation

### 6. OPS-001: Testing Coverage Gaps for Platform-Specific Features  

**Score: 3 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Good testing practices in place  
**Impact**: High (3) - Could miss critical platform-specific bugs

**Mitigation**: Set up CI testing on multiple platforms, manual testing procedures for each OS
