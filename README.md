## Architecture

This project follows the Elm Architecture pattern with:

- **Model**: Immutable application state
- **View**: Pure functions that render the UI
- **Update**: State transitions based on messages

The TUI is built using the Bubble Tea framework, providing a reactive, component-based architecture similar to modern web frameworks but for terminal applications.
