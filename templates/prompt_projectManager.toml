Based on this analysis, you must generate a `git diff` that updates ONLY the documentation files (within `architecture/` and `tasks/` directories, and their respective `index.md` files) to: 1. Accurately reflect the current state of the codebase. 2. Present an up-to-date architecture description. 3. Formulate an up-to-date task tree that aligns with the implemented features and current system state. You must strictly adhere to `Guiding Principles`, `User Rules`, and the `Documentation System Concept`. Your *sole and exclusive output* must be a single `git diff` formatted text. Zero tolerance for any deviation from the specified output format. **Absolutely no changes to source code files or any files outside the specified documentation directories are permitted.**"
